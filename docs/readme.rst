**THeSeuSS** (**TH**\ z **S**\ pectra **S**\ imulations **S**\ oftware) is an open source, advanced, automated Python platform designed to simulate IR, Raman and THz spectra for both periodic and non-periodic systems.

Utilizing Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) methods, ``THeSeuSS`` offers robust capabilities for detailed vibrational spectra simulations. With its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with established computational chemistry software (``FHIaims`` for DFT and ``DFTB+`` for DFTB calculations), ``THeSeuSS`` significantly enhances the accessibility and applicability of advanced spectroscopic simulations, supporting research and development in chemical, pharmaceutical, and material sciences.
